Both the code files expect the following files for input to be present in the same directory as the code file:

- X_seen.npy: containing the training data. Each X_seen[i] contains the training data for ith seen class
- class_attributes_seen.npy: containing the class attributes for the 40 seen classes
- class_attributes_unseen.npy: containing the class attributes of the 10 unseen classes
- Xtest.npy: Containing the test examples
- Ytest.npy: Containing the correct labels for the test examples

To run the code, simply use the command
```
    python3 convex.py
```
and
```
    python3 regress.py    
```

The model prints the accuracy as output.
