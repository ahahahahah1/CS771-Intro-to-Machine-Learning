# CS771-Intro-to-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the graded homeworks of the introductory machine learning course at IIT Kanpur taken up by me under the instruction of [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/). The assignments were based on theoretical extensions to concepts taught in class as well as some programming assignments in Python.
